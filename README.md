# automate_patch_arista_switch
This python script uses ssh2, a hostlist CSV and an ftp server to patch arista switches automatically

This script has two options:

For a unique IP - only one switch is affected
For a group of IPs - all switches are going to be patched

Make sure to comment and uncomment the right option inside the .py file
The default is a group of switches
